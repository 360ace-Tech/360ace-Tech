Kubernetes provides a portable, extensible platform to automate deployment, scaling, and management of containerized workloads. Teams choose it to standardize environments, improve release velocity, and strengthen reliability.

### Benefits

- Declarative infra and desired state reconciliation.
- Horizontal scaling and bin-packing efficiency.
- Extensibility via CRDs and operators.
- Strong ecosystem (service mesh, policy, observability).

### When to be cautious

- Small/simple apps may not need k8s complexity.
- Operate with paved roads (platform team) and clear SLOs.

Start with a managed control plane and focus on the developer platform experience (templates, docs, golden paths).
